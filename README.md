# Raspberry Pi Smart Bike

## Materials List
- Raspberry Pi Zero x2

## Functionalities
- Hidden one under bike seat tracks my bike if it gets stolen and possibly takes metrics from my bike rides (sampled speed with location markers, if push button where felt dangerous can mark places I don't like to ride at)
- One alarms VERY LOUD if someone tampers with the U-lock :<
